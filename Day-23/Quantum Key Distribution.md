# Quantum Key Distribution

Public key cryptography has the a problem, How can we share public key with each entities in advanced ? Quantum Mechanics provides a solution with variety of protocols called Quantum Key Distribution. 

The first QKD algorithm is BB84 Protocol.

How Alice and Bob can share securely a key which can be used for private key encryption ?
