# Quantum Internets

Individuals and Institutions are started to stored the lots of the encrypted data like Passwards, bank details, sensitive informations etc but they can't decrypt them. Then Question arises that Why they are storing them ? The answer is that Quantum Computers, Peoples and organizations belives that in upcomming 15-20 year Quantum Computers will be advanced enough with number of qubits that can perform the complex calculations in seconds. Thus today's existing security protocols can be break by quantum computers later. hence this process is called SNDL i.e Store Now and Decrypt Later becouse there are some information which will be valuable after 20-25 years like Industrial, Pharmasutical research, Government Intelligence etc.

SNDL seems like threats to organisations, Governments etc, because today's existing protocols will be broken later by quantum c   omputers.

Government started to fund to develop new methods of quantum cryptography that can't be broken by quantum computers i.e Quantum-Resistant.

How communication held between two entities ?

- In-persion communication mean Alice encypt message using some key and send the cipher along with key to Bob and Bob with decrypt the message using same key : Symmetric Key Algorithms are secure until Eavesdropper don't know about the key.
- How can we shere information without sharing encryption key i.e Alice will use some public key for encryption and Bob will also use the Publically available key for Decryption. It can be achieved by the many public key based algorithms like RSA(Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, Leonard Adleman)

Factoring Algorithm : General Number Field Sieve. We uses the public key upto 300 digits after multiplication it's a huge number whose factarization can't possible via classical computers because it takes huge amount of time upto 16 millian years. But via Quantum Computing this is not the case, they can be factorized in desired amount of time.

In 1993 Peter Shor and Don Coppersmith , Quantum Fourier Transforms similar to the Classical Fourier Transforms
