# Day-30 Quantum Cryptography - Quantum30ChallengeReview

Quantum Cryptography is form of two words Quantum for Quantum Computing and Cryptography for Information Security. Thus, Quantum Cryptography is all about the security of quantum information i.e applying quantum computing to the cryptographic tasks. I graduated with the degree of the Applied Mathematics and It's the my field to study to master the cryptography from classical cryptography, quantum cryptography to post quantum cryptography. 


Today, I can say that I really gets losts of insignts in the field of cryptography
