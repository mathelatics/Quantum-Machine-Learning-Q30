# Quantum Cryptography

Introduction

Quantum Cryptography is all about the keeping information secure from all types of adverseries using the effects of the quantum mechanics. 

Let's say we want to buy something online then for payment we may use the Credit/Debit Card Information or even UPI which uses the today's practically possible existing cryptographic mechanism like public key crypto-systems. 

These systems can't be decrypted even if we have algorithm as well as ecryption text via classical computer. But as soon as quantum computers are developed these system no longer remains secure because they can be easly decrypted using quantum algorithms like shor's algorithm, grover algorithm, quantum middle man attack etc.

Thus, these will be losts of fraud and loss of sensitive information means our today's existing security system will totally be compromised by the adversaries.

What is a Public Key Cryptography ?

As we already studied upto 2 week all about the classical cryptography, public key cryptography is just the subfield.


What are the risks posed by Quantum Computer ?

Theoretically we have developed the algorithms that can break today's existing approx all security mechanism but practically when we execute on classical computer, it take more and more time that expected but as soon as we developed the quantum computer it can easly execute those algorithm which lead to broke today's existing all security mechanism.

Example : Shor's Algorithm is used to factor any large Integer number into it's prime factors thus we know that RSA, Diffie-Hellmann Key exchange, Elgmal etc. uses the prime facterization, discrete log problem, elliptic curves for encryption can be easly broken.

What is Quantum cryptography ?


What is Post Quantum Cryptography ?


What is Quantum Key Distribution ?


What is Quantum Encryption ?


What is One way functions ?

These functions are easy to compute forward but when we try to compute backword way then it became hard

Example : Multiplication of two prime number and reverse is facterization of the large number into two prime.

What is Quantum One Time Pad ?
